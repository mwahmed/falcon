ECE454H1F Computer Systems Programming Fall 2013
Overview
This course goes beyond prior programming courses to teach students to better understand computer
hardware operating systems and compilers from a programmer's perspective
In particular this course leverages this improved understanding to allow students to program for good performance
Students will learn how to measure and understand program execution and behavior how to get the
most out of an optimizing compiler how memory is allocated and managed and how to exploit
caches and the memory hierarchy
Furthermore students will learn about current trends in multicore
multithreaded and data parallel hardware how to exploit parallelism in their programs the
fundamentals of parallel architectures and synchronization techniques and the recent trend of
distributed data analytics (eg big data analytics)these latter topics are relatively new to
undergraduate curricula and in increasing demand in industry
Students will get handson experience with most topics through programming assignments
