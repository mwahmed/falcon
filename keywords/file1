Assigned: Sept 16th, Due: Sept 30th, 11:59PM
The TA for this assignment is Michelle Wong (michelley.wong@mail.utoronto.ca).
1 Introduction
Upon graduation from Skule, and having become a high-performance program-optimizing guru, you decided to
open your own high-performance code optimization consulting .rm, called .OptsRus.. OptsRus. .rst client is a
recon.gurable computing company that is using the open source CAD software program VPR (developed at UofT)
to map customer designs to their recon.gurable FPGA-like hardware. However, since the demise of single-threaded
CPU performance, their customers have been complaining that VPR is not fast enough for their needs, especially
since their hardware chips keep getting bigger and hence so do the designs VPR has to handle.
The company cannot afford to parallelize the software at this point, so they instead want you to analyze the VPR
code as well as their compilation process to see if they can do better. As detailed below, you are to experiment with
both, collect measurements and pro.les, and write a report for the company (by answering the speci.c questions
below).
2 VPR
VPR is a FPGA placement and routing tool. In this assignment we will focus only on placement. VPR performs
simulated annealing based placement, as described in the lecture slides on VPR. For more info on VPR see this site
(but please only use the speci.c version of VPR that is distributed for 454 for this assignment, not the version from
this site):

3 Procedure
In your report, please answer all of the Q* questions below, with a few sentences each and any requested measurements.
HINT: you will likely .nd the use of a shell or perl/python script to automate your collection very helpful; this should
be very easy to learn, I highly recommend that you take the opportunity to do so if you do not already.
